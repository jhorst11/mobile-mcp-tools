# Grant API Access to Users

To extend API access to your Experience Cloud site users, add them to a profile or a permission set that sets the API Enabled permission. If you haven’t yet configured any profiles or permission sets to include this permission, see [Set Up an API-Enabled Profile](communities-profile.md) and [Set Up a Permission Set](communities-permission-set.md).
