# Scope Parameter Values

OAuth requires scope configuration both on server and on client. The agreement between the two sides defines the scope contract.

- **Server side**—Define scope permissions in a connected app on the Salesforce server. These settings determine which levels of access client apps, such as Mobile SDK apps, can request. At a minimum, configure your connected app OAuth settings to match what’s specified in your code. For most apps, `refresh_token`, `web`, and `api` are sufficient.
- **Client side**—Specify scope requests in your Mobile SDK app. Client scope requests must be a subset of the connected app’s scope permissions.

## Server Side Configuration

You can set the following scope parameter values.

In addition to the access token, this scope enables you to receive a signed ID token that conforms to the [OpenID Connect specifications](http://openid.net/connect/). |
| **Full access** (`full`)                                                      | Allows access to all data accessible by the logged-in user, and encompasses all other scopes.`full` doesn’t return a refresh token. You must explicitly request the `refresh_token` scope to get a refresh token.                                                                                                                                           |
| **Perform requests at any time** (`refresh_token, offline_access`)            | Allows a refresh token to be returned when the requesting client is eligible to receive one. With a refresh token, the app can interact with the user’s data while the user is offline. This token is synonymous with requesting `offline_access`.                                                                                                          |
| **Access Visualforce applications** (`visualforce`)                           | Allows access to customer-created Visualforce pages only. This scope doesn’t allow access to standard Salesforce UIs.To allow hybrid apps to directly obtain Visualforce child sessions, include this scope with the OAuth 2.0 hybrid app token flow or hybrid app refresh token flow.                                                                      |

| **Access chatbot services** (`chatbot_api`)                                   | Allows access to Einstein Bot API services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Access Headless Registration API** (user_registration_api)                  | Allows access to the API for the Headless Registration Flow. If you set up your flow to require authentication, you must pass in an access token that includes this scope.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Access Headless Forgot Password API** (`forgot_password`)                   | Allows access to the API for the Headless Forgot Password Flow. If you set up your flow to require authentication, you must pass in an access token that includes this scope.                                                                                                                                                                               |

:::note

For Mobile SDK apps, you’re always required to select `refresh_token` in server-side Connected App settings. Even if you select the `full` scope, you still must explicitly select `refresh_token`.

:::

## Client Side Configuration

The following rules govern scope configuration for Mobile SDK apps.

| Scope           | Mobile SDK App Configuration                                                                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `refresh_token` | Implicitly requested by Mobile SDK for your app; no need to include in your app’s list of scopes.                   |
| `api`           | Include if you’re  making any Salesforce REST API calls (applies to most apps).                                     |
| `web`           | Include if your app accesses pages defined in a Salesforce org (for any app that loads Salesforce-based web pages.) |
| `full`          | Include to request all permissions. (Mobile SDK implicitly requests `refresh_token` for you.)                       |
| `chatter_api`   | Include if your app calls Connect REST APIs.                                                                        |
| `id`            | (Not needed)                                                                                                        |
| `visualforce`   | Use `web` instead.                                                                                                  |
