# Create a Facebook App

To enable Experience Cloud site logins through Facebook, start by creating a Facebook app.

A Facebook app is comparable to a Salesforce connected app. It is a container for settings that govern the connectivity and authentication of your app on mobile devices.

1.  Go to [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com).

2.  Log in with your Facebook developer account, or register if you’re not a registered Facebook developer.

3.  Go to **Apps** | **Create a New App**.

4.  Set display name to “FineApps Experience Cloud Site Test”.

5.  Add a Namespace, if you want. Per Facebook’s requirements, a namespace label must be twenty characters or less, using only lowercase letters, dashes, and underscores. For example, “my_fb_goodapps”.<!-- (rw_sfdc_goodapps) -->

6.  For Category, choose **Utilities**.<!-- (Utilities)-->

7.  Copy and store your App ID <!-- (850894811604028) -->and App Secret <!-- (d83c09557e9331aedeff2fe2945f3080)--> for later use.

You can log in to the app using the following URL:

`https://developers.facebook.com/apps/<App ID>/dashboard/`
