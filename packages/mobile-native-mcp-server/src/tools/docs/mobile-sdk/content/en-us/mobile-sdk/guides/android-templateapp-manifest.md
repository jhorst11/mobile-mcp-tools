# Template Manifest

A look at the `AndroidManifest.xml` file in the template project reveals the components required for Mobile SDK native Android apps. The only required component is the activity named “`.MainActivity`”. This component represents the first activity that is called after login. A class by this name is defined in the project.

Because any app created by forcedroid is based on a Mobile SDK template project, the `MainActivity` component is already included in its manifest. As with any Android app, you can add other components, such as custom activities or services, by editing the manifest in Android Studio.
