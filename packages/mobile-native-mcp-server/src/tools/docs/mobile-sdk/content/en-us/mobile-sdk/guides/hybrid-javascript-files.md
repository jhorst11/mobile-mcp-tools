# JavaScript Files for Hybrid Apps

## External Dependencies

Mobile SDK uses the following external dependencies for various features of hybrid apps.

| External JavaScript File | Description                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| jquery.js                | Popular HTML utility library |
| underscore.js            | Mobile Sync support          |
| backbone.js              | Mobile Sync support          |

## Which JavaScript Files Do I Include?

Beginning with Mobile SDK 2.3, the Cordova utility copies the Cordova plug-in files your application needs to your project’s platform directories. You don’t need to add those files to your www/ folder.

Files that you include in your HTML code (with a \<script> tag> depend on the type of hybrid project. For each type described here, include all files in the list.

**For basic hybrid apps:**

- `cordova.js`

**To make REST API calls from a basic hybrid app:**

- `cordova.js`
- `force.js`

**To use Mobile Sync in a hybrid app:**

- `jquery.js`
- `underscore.js`
- `backbone.js`
- `cordova.js`
- `force.js`
- `mobilesync.js`
