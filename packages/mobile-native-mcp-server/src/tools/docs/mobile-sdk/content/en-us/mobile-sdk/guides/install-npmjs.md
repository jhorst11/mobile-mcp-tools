# Mobile SDK npm Packages

Most mobile developers want to use Mobile SDK as a “black box” and begin creating apps as quickly as possible. For this use case Salesforce provides a set of npm packages. Each package installs a command line tool that you can use at a Terminal window or in a Windows command prompt.

Mobile SDK command line tools provide a static snapshot of an SDK release. For iOS, the npm package installs binary modules rather than uncompiled source code. For Android, the npm package installs a snapshot of the SDK source code rather than binaries. You use the npm scripts not only to access Mobile SDK libraries, but also to create projects.

Mobile SDK provides the following command line tools:

- forcedroid

  - : Creates native Android projects in Java or Kotlin.

- forceios

  - : Creates native iOS projects in Swift or Objective-C.

- forcehybrid

  - : Creates a hybrid project based on Cordova with build targets for iOS, Android, or both.

- forcereact

  - : Creates a React Native project with build targets for iOS, Android, or both.

Npm packages reside at [https://www.npmjs.org](https://www.npmjs.org). We recommend installing Mobile SDK packages globally using the following command:

- **On Windows:**

  - ```nolang

    npm install -g <NPM-PACKAGE-NAME>

    ```

    where npm-package-name is one of the following:

    - `forcedroid`
    - `forceios`
    - `forcehybrid`
    - `forcereact`

  - To install a package locally, omit `-g`.
  <!-- -->

- **On Mac OS X:**

  - ```nolang
    sudo npm install -g <NPM-PACKAGE-NAME>
    ```

    where npm-package-name is one of the following:

    - `forcedroid`
    - `forceios`
    - `forcehybrid`
    - `forcereact`

  - If you have read-write permissions to `/usr/local/bin/`, you can omit `sudo`.
  - To install a package locally in a user-owned directory, omit `sudo` and `-g`.

- If npm doesn’t exist on your system, install the latest release of Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://www.nodejs.org).
- Npm packages do not support source control, so you can’t update your installation dynamically for new releases. Instead, you install each release separately. To upgrade to new versions of the SDK, go to the [npmjs.org](https://www.npmjs.org) website and download the new package.

:::note

The forceios npm utility is provided as an optional convenience. CocoaPods, node.js, and npm are required for forceios but are not required for Mobile SDK iOS development. To learn how to create Mobile SDK iOS native projects without forceios, see [Creating an iOS Swift Project Manually](ios-new-native-project-manual.md).
