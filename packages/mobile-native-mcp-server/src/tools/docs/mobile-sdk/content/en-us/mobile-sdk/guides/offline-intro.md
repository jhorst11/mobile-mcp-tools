# Using SmartStore to Securely Store Offline Data

Mobile devices can lose connection at any time, and environments such as hospitals and airplanes often prohibit connectivity. To handle these situations, it’s important that your mobile apps continue to function when they go offline.

Mobile SDK provides SmartStore, a multithreaded, secure solution for offline storage on mobile devices. With SmartStore, your customers can continue working with data in a secure environment even when the device loses connectivity. When you couple SmartStore with Mobile Sync, you can easily keep local SmartStore data in sync with the Salesforce server when connectivity resumes.
