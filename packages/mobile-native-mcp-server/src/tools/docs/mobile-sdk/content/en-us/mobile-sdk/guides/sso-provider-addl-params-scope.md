# Use the Scope URL Parameter

When you set up single sign-on (SSO) with an authentication provider, use the scope parameter to customize data requests to a third party, like Facebook. For example, request access to the email address listed on a user’s Facebook profile. You can use this parameter with every authentication provider except Janrain.

In an authentication provider SSO flow, scopes define the type of data the relying party can request. After the user logs in, the relying party sends an authorization request. The third party validates the user and sends back the access token with scopes. If the user authorizes access to the data defined by the scopes, the relying party can access the requested third-party data.

For example, you set up a Google authentication provider to configure SSO with your Salesforce org as the relying party. You want to give users the ability to view their Google Drive in your Salesforce org. So you add the scope parameter to your SSO client configuration URL and implement an `Auth.AuthToken` method to retrieve the access token with the scopes you requested. A user logs in to your org, is redirected to authenticate with Google, and then approves Salesforce to access their Google Drive. Salesforce then displays the user’s Google Drive in Salesforce.

:::note

Some third parties require you to pre-register scopes before you can request them.

:::

In addition to any scopes you specify, authentication providers provide default scopes. The default scopes vary depending on the third party, but they usually limit access to basic user information. For example, the Salesforce default scope is `id`, which gives you the user’s identity. To override default scopes, send scopes in a space-delimited string to the third party.

1.  Add the scope parameter to a client configuration URL.

2.  Use Apex `Auth.AuthToken` methods to retrieve the access token. See [AuthToken Class](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_class_Auth_AuthToken.htm) in the Apex Reference Guide for more information.

## Example

Here’s an example of a scope parameter requesting the Salesforce scopes api and webadded to the Single Sign-On Initialization URL. Salesforceapi scope allows the relying party to access Connect REST API resources, while the web scope allows the relying party to use the access token on the web.`https://login.salesforce.com/services/auth/sso/{orgID}/{URLsuffix}?scope=id+api+web`

- _orgID_ is your Auth. Provider ID.
- _URLsuffix_ is the value you specified when you defined the authentication provider.

Valid scopes vary depending on the third party, so refer to your third-party documentation.

You must explicitly request the `refresh_token` scope to get a refresh token.                                                                                                                                            |
| **Perform requests at any time** (`refresh_token, offline_access`)            | Allows a refresh token to be returned when the requesting client is eligible to receive one. With a refresh token, the app can interact with the user’s data while the user is offline. This token is synonymous with requesting `offline_access`.                                                                                                           |
