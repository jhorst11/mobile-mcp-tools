# About Backbone Technology

The Mobile Sync library, `mobilesync.js`, provides extensions to the open-source Backbone JavaScript library. The Backbone library defines key building blocks for structuring your web application:

- Models with key-value binding and custom events, for modeling your information
- Collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, for containing your data sets
- Views with declarative event handling, for displaying information in your models
- A router for controlling navigation between views

Salesforce Mobile Sync extends the `Model` and `Collection` core Backbone objects to connect them to the Salesforce REST API. Mobile Sync also provides optional offline support through SmartStore, the secure storage component of the Mobile SDK.
