# Files and Networking

Mobile SDK provides an API for files management that implements two levels of technology. For files management, Mobile SDK provides convenience methods that process file requests through the Connect REST API. Under the REST API level, networking classes give apps control over pending REST requests. Together, these two sides of the same coin give the SDK a robust content management feature as well as enhanced networking performance.
