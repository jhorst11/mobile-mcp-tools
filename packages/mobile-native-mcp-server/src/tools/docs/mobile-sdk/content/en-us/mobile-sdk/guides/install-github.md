# Mobile SDK GitHub Repositories

More adventurous developers can delve into the SDK, keep up with the latest changes, and possibly contribute to SDK development through GitHub. Using GitHub allows you to monitor source code in public pre-release development branches. In this scenario, your app includes the SDK source code, which is built along with your app.

You don’t have to sign up for GitHub to access the Mobile SDK, but it’s a good idea to join this social coding community. [https://github.com/forcedotcom](https://github.com/forcedotcom)

You can always find the latest Mobile SDK releases in our public repositories:

- [`https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS`](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS)
- [`https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-Android`](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-Android)

:::important

To submit pull requests for any Mobile SDK platform, check out the `**dev**` branch as the basis for your changes.

If you’re using GitHub only to build source code for the current release, check out the `**master**` branch.

## Cloning the Mobile SDK for iOS GitHub Repository (Optional)

Many tools exist for cloning and managing local GitHub repos. The following instructions show three popular ways to clone Mobile SDK plus an important post-clone installation step.

1.  Clone the repo. For example, you can use one of the following options.

    - Command line:

      1.  In the OS X Terminal app, use the `git` command, which is installed with Xcode:

          ```nolang
          git clone git://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS.git
          ```

    - Xcode:
      1.  Select **Source Control** | **Clone**.
      2.  For Save As, accept the default or type a custom directory name.
      3.  For Where, choose a convenient parent directory.
      4.  Click **Clone**.
    - GitHub Desktop for Mac ([https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)):
      1.  Click **Clone a Repository from the Internet**.
      2.  Click **URL**.
      3.  For Repository URL or GitHub username and repository, type [`https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS`](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS).
      4.  Set Local Path to a destination of your choice.
      5.  Click **Clone**.

2.  In the OS X Terminal app, change to the directory in which you cloned the repo (`SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS` by default).
3.  Run the install script from the command line: `./install.sh`

:::note

The `install.sh` script checks that you have the correct platform development tools installed. It then syncs external submodules required for Mobile SDK development to your local clone. If your development machine has stored obsolete Mobile SDK project templates for Xcode, the script removes those unnecessary files.

:::

## Cloning the Mobile SDK for Android GitHub Repository (Optional)

1.  In your browser, navigate to the Mobile SDK for Android GitHub repository: [https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-Android](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-Android).
2.  Clone the repository to your local file system by issuing the following command:

    ```nolang
    git clone git://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-Android.git
    ```

3.  Open a terminal prompt or command window in the directory where you installed the cloned repository.
4.  Run `./install.sh` on Mac, or `cscript install.vbs` on Windows

:::note

The install scripts sync external submodules required for Mobile SDK development to your local clone.After you’ve run `cscript install.vbs` on Windows, `git status` returns a list of modified and deleted files. This output is an unfortunate side effect of resolving symbolic links in the repo. Do not clean or otherwise revert these files.
