The following tutorial shows two ways to create a native iOS Swift project:

- Borrowing source files from the Mobile SDK Swift template app
- Using Swift Package Manager.

Instructions fall into four sections that must be performed in the sequence shown:

1.  [Create an Xcode Swift Project](ios-new-native-manual-create-xcode-project.md)
2.  [Add Mobile SDK Libraries to Your Project](ios-new-native-manual-clone-sdk.md)
3.  [Configure Your Project’s Build Settings](ios-new-native-manual-configure-build.md)
4.  Choose an option:
    - [Option 1: Import Mobile SDK Template Files](ios-new-native-manual-details.md)
    - [Option 2: Add Mobile SDK Setup Code Manually](ios-new-native-no-template.md)

All sections support Xcode 12.4 and Xcode 13.
