# Supporting Catalyst in Mobile SDK Apps

Beginning in version 9.1, Mobile SDK adds Catalyst support to its native frameworks. Catalyst is an Apple cross-platform product that enables iPad apps to run on Intel and Silicon Macs. Preparing Mobile SDK iPad apps to run on macOS is easy—it usually requires only a couple of additional settings in your iOS project configuration.

Mobile SDK supports macOS through Catalyst in the following frameworks:

- SalesforceSDKCommon
- SalesforceAnalytics
- SalesforceSDKCore
- SmartStore
- MobileSync

The following Mobile SDK frameworks don’t support Catalyst:

- SalesforceHybridSDK
- SalesforceReact
- SalesforceFileLogger framework (currently in development)

:::note

To run on macOS, all third-party frameworks that your app uses must also support Catalyst.

## Get Started with Catalyst

To configure your iPad apps for macOS, follow Apple’s [Turning on Mac Catalyst](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/mac-catalyst/turning-on-mac-catalyst) tutorial. In the Mac version of your app, be sure to set the deployment target to **macOS 11**.

Mobile SDK also provides examples that demonstrate Catalyst support:

- [MobileSyncExplorerSwift](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-Templates/tree/master/MobileSyncExplorerSwift) Template App

  - : You can use this template with the `forceios createwithtemplate` command to create a Catalyst-ready project.

- [RestAPIExlorer](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS/tree/dev/native/SampleApps/RestAPIExplorer) Sample App

  - :

## Special Considerations for Mobile SDK Security Features

Mobile SDK apps that use the following security features require special consideration for Catalyst.

- Passcode

  - : Passcode is a useful security gate for mobile devices such as iPhones and iPads. But does a passcode make sense when your app’s running on a Mac? We leave the decision to you—Mobile SDK passcode support is still available and works as expected on Macs.

- Snapshot

  - : Snapshot is essential on mobile devices for reasons that don’t apply to Macs. Mobile SDK automatically disables this feature in Mac versions of your app.
