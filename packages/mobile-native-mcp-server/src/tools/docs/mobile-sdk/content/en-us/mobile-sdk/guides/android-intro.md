# Native Android Development

Salesforce Mobile SDK for Android provides source code, build scripts, and native sample apps to get you up and running. It gives you template apps that implement two basic features of any Mobile SDK app:

- Automation of the OAuth2 authentication flow, making it easy to integrate the process with your app.
- Access to the Salesforce REST API, with utility classes that simplify that access.

Sample native applications show you basic techniques for implementing login, REST API calls, and other Mobile SDK features.
