# Welcome to Mobile SDK Labs!

Mobile SDK Labs is where we share information on newer technologies that we’re currently testing, or that could become unstable because they’re rapidly evolving. Check here with each release if you’re eager to experiment with the cutting edge in your Mobile SDK apps.

## Introducing Salesforce Mobile SDK Labs

Salesforce is committed to empowering developers to create mobile apps on their own terms. We hope to provide you with complete freedom to use the technologies that best serve your needs.

In the mobile development world, innovation moves at breakneck speeds. New tools, frameworks, libraries, and design patterns emerge almost on a weekly basis. Some of these technologies become mainstream—stable and secure enough for production apps—while others fade away. The Mobile SDK team is always testing emerging technologies for use with SDK libraries, samples, and resources. Salesforce Mobile SDK Labs gives you the opportunity to try out the third-party tools and frameworks as we’re investigating them.

Because Mobile SDK is a community-assisted effort, we value your feedback and typically incorporate it into our decision-making process. You can contact us at our Google+ community: SalesforceMobileSDK.

Salesforce does not officially support the apps and code in Salesforce Mobile SDK Labs. Use these projects with caution in production apps.
