# Customize Login, Self-Registration, and Password Management for Your Experience Cloud Site

Configure the standard login, logout, password management, and self-registration options for your Experience Cloud site, or customize the behavior with Apex and Visualforce.<!-- or Experience Builder (Site.com Studio) pages.-->

<!-- #REVIEW_EACH_SALESFORCE_RELEASE. This file is a slightly altered copy of the network_customize_login.xml file in Salesforce Help. We had to remove the mentions of Experience Builder because Mobile SDK doesn’t yet support that method. Reinstate the commented mentions here when that changes.-->

:::warning

**Mobile SDK does not support building apps that wrap Experience Builder sites.**

By default, each Experience Cloud site comes with default login, password management, and self-registration pages and associated Apex controllers that drive this functionality under the hood. You can use Visualforce or Apex <!-- or Experience Builder (Site.com Studio)--> to create custom branding and change the default behavior. See the following steps in Salesforce Help.

- [Brand your Experience Cloud site’s login page](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=networks_customize_login_branding.htm).

- [Customize your Experience Cloud site’s login experience](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=networks_customize_login_page.htm) by modifying the default login page behavior, using a custom login page, and supporting other authentication providers.
