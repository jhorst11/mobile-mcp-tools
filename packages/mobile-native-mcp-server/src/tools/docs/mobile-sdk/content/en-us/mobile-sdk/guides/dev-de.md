# Sign Up for Salesforce Platform

To access a wealth of tutorials, blogs, and support forums for all Salesforce developer programs, join the Salesforce Platform.

1.  In your browser go to [`https://developer.salesforce.com/signup`](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup).
2.  Fill in the fields about you and your company.
3.  In the **Email Address** field, make sure to use a public address you can easily check from a Web browser.
4.  Enter a unique **Username**. Note that this field is also in the _form_ of an email address, but it does not have to be the same as your email address, and in fact, it's usually better if they aren't the same. Your username is your login and your identity on `developer.salesforce.com`, and so you're often better served by choosing a username that describes the work you're doing, such as `develop@workbook.org`, or that describes you, such as `firstname@lastname.com`.
5.  Read and then select the checkbox for the **Main Services Agreement**.
6.  Enter the Captcha words shown and click **Submit Registration**.
7.  In a moment you'll receive an email with a login link. Click the link and change your password.
