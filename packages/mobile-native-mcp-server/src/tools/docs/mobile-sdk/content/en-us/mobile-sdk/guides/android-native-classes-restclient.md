# RestClient Class

As its name implies, the `RestClient` class is an Android app’s liaison to the Salesforce REST API.

You don’t explicitly create new instances of the `RestClient` class. Instead, you use the `ClientManager` factory class to obtain a `RestClient` instance. Once you get the `RestClient` instance, you can use it to send REST API calls to Salesforce. The method you call depends on whether you’re calling from a UI context. See [ClientManager Class](android-native-classes-clientmanager.md).

Use the following `RestClient` methods to send REST requests:

- `sendAsync()`—Call this method if you obtained your `RestClient` instance by calling `ClientManager.getRestClient()`.
- `sendSync()`—Call this method if you obtained your `RestClient` instance by calling `ClientManager.peekRestClient()`.

## sendSync() Method

You can choose from three overloads of `RestClient.sendSync()`, depending on the degree of information you can provide for the request.

## sendAsync() Method

The `RestClient.sendAsync()` method wraps your `RestRequest` object in a new instance of the `OkHttpClient` `Call` class. It then adds the `Call` object to the request queue and returns that object.

Tocancel a request while it’s pending, call `cancel()` on the `Call` object. To access the underlying request queue object, use the `OkHttpClient` class. See examples at [Managing the Request Queue](files-android-managing.md).
