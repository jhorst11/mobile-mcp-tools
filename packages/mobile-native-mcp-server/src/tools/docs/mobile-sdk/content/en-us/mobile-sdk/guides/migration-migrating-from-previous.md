# Migrating from the Previous Release

If you’re upgrading an app built with Salesforce Mobile SDK 12.2, follow the instructions in [Migrate All Apps from 12.2 to 13.0](migrate-all-apps-from-12.2-to-13.0.md).

If you’re upgrading an app that’s built with a version earlier than Salesforce Mobile SDK 12.1, start upgrading with [Migrating from Earlier Releases](migration-migrating-from-earlier.md).
