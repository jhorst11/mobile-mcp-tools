# Accessing Custom API Endpoints

In Mobile SDK 2.1, Mobile Sync expands its scope to let you work with any REST API. Previously, you could only perform basic operations on sObjects with the Salesforce Platform API. Now you can use Mobile Sync with Apex REST objects, Chatter Files, and any other Salesforce REST API.  You can also call non-Salesforce REST APIs.
