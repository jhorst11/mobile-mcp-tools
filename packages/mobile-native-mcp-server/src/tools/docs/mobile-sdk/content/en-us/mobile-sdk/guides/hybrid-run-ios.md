# Build and Run Your Hybrid App On iOS

After you’ve run `cordova prepare` on an iOS hybrid app, you can open the project in Xcode to run the app in an iOS simulator.

To run the app in Xcode:

1.  In Xcode, select **File** | **Open**.

2.  Navigate to the `platforms/ios/` directory in your new app’s directory.

3.  Double-click the `<*app name*>.xcodeworkspace` file.

4.  Click the Run button in the upper left corner, or press `COMMAND-R`.
