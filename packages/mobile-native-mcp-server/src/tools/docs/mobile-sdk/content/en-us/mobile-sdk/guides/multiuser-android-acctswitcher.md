# AccountSwitcherActivity Class

Use or extend the `AccountSwitcherActivity` class to display the user switching interface.

The `AccountSwitcherActivity` class provides the screen that handles multi-user logins. It displays a list of existing user accounts and lets the user switch between existing accounts or sign into a new account. To enable multi-user logins, launch the activity from somewhere in your app using the following code:

```java
final Intent i = new Intent(this, SalesforceSDKManager.getInstance().
    getAccountSwitcherActivityClass());
i.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
this.startActivity(i);

```

For instance, you might launch this activity from a “Switch User” button in your user interface. See `SampleApps/RestExplorer` for an example.

If you like, you can customize and stylize `AccountSwitcherActivity` through XML.

For more control, you can extend `AccountSwitcherActivity` and replace it with your own custom sub-class. To replace the default class, call `SalesforceSDKManager.setAccountSwitcherActivityClass()`. Pass in a reference to the class file of your replacement activity class, such as `AccountSwitcherActivity.class`.
