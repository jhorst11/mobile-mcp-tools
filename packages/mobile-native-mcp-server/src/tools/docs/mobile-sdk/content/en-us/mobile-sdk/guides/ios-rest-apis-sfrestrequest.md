# REST Request Class

| Swift         | Objective-C     |

| `RestRequest` | `SFRestRequest` |

The `RestRequest` interface provides an uncomplicated way to make network calls. This class is the container for your request metadata, but you rarely manipulate the request object manually. The request object itself formats its metadata for transmission over HTTP. To send your requests to the Salesforce server, the `RestRequest` object configures the network parameters and the REST API syntax. If the object was created for a Salesforce resource, the class knows how to calculate the endpoint. Otherwise, you configure a custom path.

`RestRequest`—not `RestClient`— provides methods for configuring a REST request that isn’t explicitly supported by Mobile SDK. For example, to use the Connect REST API or an external service, you manually create and configure a `RestRequest` object.
