# Building Hybrid Apps With Cordova

Salesforce Mobile SDK 11.1 provides a hybrid container that uses a specific version of Apache Cordova for each platform (7.0.1 for iOS, 12.0.1 for Android). Architecturally, Mobile SDK hybrid apps are Cordova apps that use Salesforce Mobile SDK as a Cordova plug-in. Cordova provides a simple command line tool for updating the plug-in in an app. To read more about Cordova benefits, see [https://cordova.apache.org/](https://cordova.apache.org/).
