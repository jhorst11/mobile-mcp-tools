# Brand Your Experience Cloud Site

If you are using the Salesforce Tabs + Visualforce template, you can customize the look and feel of your Experience Cloud site in Experience Workspaces. You can customize by adding your company logo, colors, and copyright. Customizing these elements ensures that your Experience Cloud site matches your company’s branding and is instantly recognizable to your site members.

<!-- #REVIEW_EACH_SALESFORCE_RELEASE. This file is a slightly altered copy of the network_customize_branind.xml file in Salesforce Help. We had to remove the mentions of Experience Builder because Mobile SDK doesn’t yet support that method. Un-future the following note when that changes.-->

:::note

**Mobile SDK does not support building apps that wrap Experience Builder sites.**

Let’s say you’re using a self-service template or you use Experience Builder to create custom pages in lieu of standard Salesforce tabs. You can use Experience Builder to design your Experience Cloud site’s branding, too.

1.  Open [Experience Workspaces](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.networks_community_workspaces_access.htm&type=5).

2.  Click **Administration** | **Branding**.

3.  Use the lookups to choose a header and footer for the Experience Cloud site.

    The files you’re choosing for header and footer must have been previously uploaded to the Documents tab and must be publicly available. The header can be .html, .gif, .jpg, or .png. The footer must be an .html file. The maximum file size for .html files is 100 KB combined. The maximum file size for .gif, .jpg, or .png files is 20 KB. Let’s say you have a header .html file that’s 70 KB and you want to use an .html file for the footer. The footer .html file can be only 30 KB.

    The header you choose replaces the Salesforce logo below the global header. The footer you choose replaces the standard Salesforce copyright and privacy footer.

4.  To select from predefined color schemes, click **Select Color Scheme**. To select a color from the color picker, click the text box next to the page section fields.

    Some of the selected colors impact your Experience Cloud site login page and how your site looks in the Salesforce mobile app as well.
