# Introduction to Salesforce Mobile SDK Development

Salesforce Mobile SDK lets you harness the power of Salesforce Platform within stand-alone mobile apps.

Salesforce Platform provides a straightforward and productive platform for Salesforce cloud computing. Developers can use Salesforce Platform to define Salesforce application components—custom objects and fields, workflow rules, Visualforce pages, Apex classes, and triggers. They can then assemble those components into awesome, browser-based desktop apps.

Unlike a desktop app, a Mobile SDK app accesses Salesforce data through a mobile device’s native operating system rather than through a browser. To ensure a satisfying and productive mobile user experience, you can configure Mobile SDK apps to move seamlessly between online and offline states. Before you dive into Mobile SDK, take a look at how mobile development works, and learn about essential Salesforce developer resources.
