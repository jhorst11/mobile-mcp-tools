# HTML5 and Hybrid Development

HTML5 lets you create lightweight mobile interfaces without installing software on the target device. Any mobile, touch or desktop device can access these mobile interfaces. HTML5 now supports advanced mobile functionality such as camera and GPS, making it simple to use these popular device features in your Salesforce mobile app.

You can create an HTML5 application that leverages the Salesforce Platform by:

- Using Visualforce to deliver the HTML content
- Using JavaScript remoting to invoke Apex controllers for fetching records from Salesforce

In addition, you can repurpose HTML5 code in a standalone Mobile SDK hybrid app, and then distribute it through an app store. To convert to hybrid, you use the third-party Cordova command line to create a Mobile SDK container project, and then import your HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS files into that project.
