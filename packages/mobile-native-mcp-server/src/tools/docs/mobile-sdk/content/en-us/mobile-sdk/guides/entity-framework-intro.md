# Using Mobile Sync to Access Salesforce Objects

Mobile Sync enables mobile customers whose devices have lost connectivity to continue working on Salesforce data. When connectivity is restored, Mobile Sync synchronizes any changes made to local SmartStore records with the corresponding records on the Salesforce server.

Mobile Sync predefines cache policies for fine-tuning interactions between cached data and server data in offline and online scenarios. Mobile SDK convenience methods automate common network activities—fetching sObject metadata, fetching a list of most recently used objects, and building SOQL and SOSL queries.
