# Mobile SDK Tools for Developers

Mobile SDK provides tools that help developers see what’s happening in their apps at runtime.

For instance, you can inspect and query SmartStore soups, browse authenticated users, and view the user agent string. These tools are designed primarily for debugging purposes. In most cases, you disable this information in production builds.
