# Enabling SmartStore in Hybrid and Native Apps

To use SmartStore in hybrid Android apps, you perform a few extra steps.

Hybrid apps access SmartStore through JavaScript. To enable offline access in a hybrid app, your Visualforce or HTML page must include the `cordova.js` library file.

In forceios and forcedroid native apps, SmartStore is always included.
