# Introduction to Mobile Development

From impromptu videos to mobile geolocation to online shopping, people everywhere use modern mobile devices to create and consume content. Corporate employees, too, use smart devices to connect with customers, stay in touch with coworkers, and engage the public on social networks.

For enterprise IT departments, the explosion of mobile interaction requires a quick response in software services. Salesforce provides the Salesforce Platform to address this need. This cloud supports the most popular mobile operating systems on various form factors—phone, tablet, wearable. Its technologies let you build custom apps, connect to data from any system, and manage your enterprise from anywhere.

Salesforce Mobile SDK supports the Salesforce Platform. With Mobile SDK, developers can create standalone mobile apps that access the platform through Salesforce APIs.
