# Native iOS Development

Salesforce Mobile SDK delivers libraries and sample Xcode projects for developing native mobile apps on iOS. For writing native iOS code, Mobile SDK supports Swift and Objective-C. Swift is recommended for all new and future development.

When you create a native app using the forceios utility, your project starts as a fully functioning app. This app lets you log in to a Salesforce org, and then it displays live Salesforce data. A newly minted forceios app doesn’t do much else, but it shows you that basic SDK features are working as designed.
