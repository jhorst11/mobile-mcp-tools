# Removing UIWebView from iOS Hybrid Apps

In 2018, Apple deprecated `UIWebView` in favor of `WKWebView`. The App Store recently announced a timeline for formally removing apps that still use `UIWebView`. To conform to these requirements, Mobile SDK has removed all its references to `UIWebView`.

Mobile SDK phased in the `UIWebView` replacement over three release cycles. However, when Mobile SDK 8.0 was being developed, Cordova—the underlying technology for Mobile SDK hybrid apps—still referenced `UIWebView` in its code base. With no means of removing these unused references, Mobile SDK 8.0 couldn’t satisfy the new App Store requirements.

Mobile SDK 8.1 adopts the new Cordova 5.1.1 release, which allows clients to “compile out” its `UIWebView` code. As a result, Mobile SDK 8.1 is ready for App Store submittals.
