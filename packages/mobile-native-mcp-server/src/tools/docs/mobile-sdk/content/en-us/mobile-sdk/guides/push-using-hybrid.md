# Using Push Notifications in Hybrid Apps

To use push notifications in a hybrid app, first be sure to

- Register for push notifications with the OS provider.
- Configure your connected app to support push notifications for your target device platform.

Salesforce Mobile SDK lets your hybrid app register itself to receive notifications, and then you define the behavior that handles incoming notifications.
