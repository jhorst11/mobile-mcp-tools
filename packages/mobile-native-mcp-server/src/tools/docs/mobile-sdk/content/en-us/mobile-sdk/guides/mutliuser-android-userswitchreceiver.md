# UserSwitchReceiver Class

If your native Android app caches data other than tokens, implement the `UserSwitchReceiver` abstract class to receive notifications of user switching events.

Every time a user switch occurs, Mobile SDK broadcasts an intent. The intent action is declared in the `UserAccountManager` class as:

```java
public static final String USER_SWITCH_INTENT_ACTION =
    "com.salesforce.USERSWITCHED";
```

This broadcast event gives applications a chance to properly refresh their cached resources to accommodate user switching. To help apps listen for this event, Mobile SDK provides the `UserSwitchReceiver` abstract class. This class is implemented in the following Salesforce activity classes:

- `SalesforceActivity`
- `SalesforceListActivity`
- `SalesforceExpandableListActivity`

<!-- -->

- If your main activity extends one of the Salesforce activity classes, you don’t need to implement `UserSwitchReceiver`.

  - : If you’ve cached only tokens in memory, you don’t need to do anything—Mobile SDK automatically refreshes tokens.

    If you’ve cached user data other than tokens, override your activity’s `refreshIfUserSwitched()` method with your custom refresh actions.

- If your main activity does not extend one of the Salesforce activity classes, implement `UserSwitchReceiver` to handle cached data during user switching.

  - : To set up the broadcast receiver:

    1.  Implement a subclass of `UserSwitchReceiver`.
    2.  Register your subclass as a receiver in your activity’s `onCreate()` method.
    3.  Unregister your receiver in your activity’s `onDestroy()` method.

    For an example, see the `ExplorerActivity` class in the `RestExplorer` sample application.

- If your application is a hybrid application, no action is required.

  - : The `SalesforceDroidGapActivity` class refreshes the cache as needed when a user switch occurs.

## Methods

A single method requires implementation.
