# Multi-User Support in Mobile SDK

If you need to enable simultaneous logins for multiple users, Mobile SDK provides a basic implementation and APIs for user switching.

Mobile SDK provides a default dialog box that lets the user select from authenticated accounts. Your app implements some means of launching the dialog box and calls the APIs that initiate the user switching workflow.
