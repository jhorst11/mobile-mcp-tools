# SFRestAPI (QueryBuilder) Category

If you’re unsure of the correct syntax for a SOQL query or a SOSL search, you can get help from the `SFRestAPI (QueryBuilder)` category methods. These methods build query strings from basic conditions that you specify, and return the formatted string. You can pass the returned string to `SFRestAPI` or `RestClient` request methods for query or search.

`SFRestAPI (QueryBuilder)` provides two static methods each for SOQL queries and SOSL searches: one takes minimal parameters, while the other accepts a full list of options. Swift versions of these methods are not defined explicitly by Mobile SDK. To code these methods in Swift, use the autocomplete suggestions offered by the Xcode compiler. These suggested method and parameter names are determined by Swift compiler heuristics and can differ from their Objective-C equivalents.

## SOSL Methods

SOSL query builder methods are:

- Swift (Compiler-generated)

  - :
    ```swift
    RestClient.soslSearch(withSearchTerm:objectScope:)
    RestClient.soslSearch(withSearchTerm:fieldScope:objectScope:limit:)
    ```

- Objective-C

  - :

    ```nolang
    + (NSString *) SOSLSearchWithSearchTerm:(NSString *)term
                                objectScope:(NSDictionary *)objectScope;


    + (NSString *) SOSLSearchWithSearchTerm:(NSString *)term
                                 fieldScope:(NSString *)fieldScope
                                objectScope:(NSDictionary *)objectScope
                                      limit:(NSInteger)limit;
    ```

Parameters for the SOSL search methods are:

- | Swift            | Objective-C |
  | ---------------- | ----------- |
  | `withSearchTerm` | `term`      |

- The search string. This string can be any arbitrary value. The method escapes any SOSL reserved characters before processing the search.

  | Swift        | Objective-C  |
  | ------------ | ------------ |
  | `fieldScope` | `fieldScope` |

- Indicates which fields to search. It’s either `nil` or one of the IN search group expressions: “IN ALL FIELDS”, “IN EMAIL FIELDS”, “IN NAME FIELDS”, “IN PHONE FIELDS”, or “IN SIDEBAR FIELDS”. A `nil` value defaults to “IN NAME FIELDS”. See [Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL)](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs?filter_text=sosl).

  | Swift         | Objective-C   |
  | ------------- | ------------- |
  | `objectScope` | `objectScope` |

- Specifies the objects to search. Acceptable values are:

  - `nil`—No scope restrictions. Searches all searchable objects.

  - An `NSDictionary` object pointer—Corresponds to the SOSL RETURNING fieldspec. Each key is an `sObject` name; each value is a string that contains a field list as well as optional WHERE, ORDER BY, and LIMIT clauses for the key object.

    If you use an `NSDictionary` object, each value must contain at least a field list. For example, to represent the following SOSL statement in a dictionary entry:

    ```sql
    FIND {Widget Smith}
    IN Name Fields
    RETURNING Widget__c (name Where createddate = THIS_FISCAL_QUARTER)
    ```

    set the key to “Widget\_\_c” and its value to “name WHERE `createddate` = “THIS_FISCAL_QUARTER”. For example:

    ```sql
    [SFRestAPI
        SOSLSearchWithSearchTerm:@"all of these will be escaped:~{]"
                     objectScope:[NSDictionary
                                  dictionaryWithObject:@"name WHERE
                                                createddate="THIS_FISCAL_QUARTER"
                                                forKey:@"Widget__c"]];
    ```

  - `NSNull`—No scope specified.

  | Swift   | Objective-C |
  | ------- | ----------- |
  | `limit` | `limit`     |

- To limit the number of results returned, set this parameter to the maximum number of results you want to receive.

## SOQL Methods

SOQL QueryBuilder methods that construct SOQL strings are:

- Swift (Compiler-generated)

  - :
    ```swift
    RestClient.soqlQuery(withFields:sObject:whereClause:limit:)
    RestClient.soqlQuery(withFields:sObject:whereClause:groupBy:having:orderBy:limit:)
    ```

- Objective-C

  - :

    ```nolang
    + (NSString *) SOQLQueryWithFields:(NSArray *)fields
                               sObject:(NSString *)sObject
                                 where:(NSString *)where
                                 limit:(NSInteger)limit;

    + (NSString *) SOQLQueryWithFields:(NSArray *)fields
                               sObject:(NSString *)sObject
                                 where:(NSString *)where
                               groupBy:(NSArray *)groupBy
                                having:(NSString *)having
                               orderBy:(NSArray *)orderBy
                                 limit:(NSInteger)limit;

    ```

Parameters for the SOQL methods correspond to SOQL query syntax. All parameters except `withFields`/`fields` and `sObject` can be set to `nil`.

- | Swift        | Objective-C |
  | ------------ | ----------- |
  | `withFields` | `fields`    |

- An array of field names to be queried.

  | Swift     | Objective-C |
  | --------- | ----------- |
  | `sObject` | `sObject`   |

- Name of the object to query.

  | Swift         | Objective-C |
  | ------------- | ----------- |
  | `whereClause` | `where`     |

- An expression specifying one or more query conditions.

  | Swift     | Objective-C |
  | --------- | ----------- |
  | `groupBy` | `groupBy`   |

- An array of field names to use for grouping the resulting records.

  | Swift    | Objective-C |
  | -------- | ----------- |
  | `having` | `having`    |

- An expression, usually using an aggregate function, for filtering the grouped results. Used only with `groupBy`.

  | Swift     | Objective-C |
  | --------- | ----------- |
  | `orderBy` | `orderBy`   |

- An array of fields name to use for ordering the resulting records.

  | Swift   | Objective-C |
  | ------- | ----------- |
  | `limit` | `limit`     |

- Maximum number of records you want returned.

See [SOQL SELECT Syntax](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql_select.htm).

## SOSL Sanitizing

The `QueryBuilder` category also provides a class method for cleaning SOSL search terms:

- Swift

  - :
    ```swift
    RestClient.sanitizeSOSLSearchTerm(_:)
    ```

- Objective-C

  - :

    ```nolang
    + (NSString *) sanitizeSOSLSearchTerm:(NSString *)searchTerm;
    ```

    This method escapes every SOSL reserved character in the input string, and returns the escaped version. For example:

- Swift

  - :
    ```swift
    let cleanSOSL = RestClient.sanitizeSOSLSearchTerm(_: "FIND {MyProspect}")
    ```

- Objective-C

  - :

    ```nolang

    NSString *soslClean = [SFRestAPI sanitizeSOSLSearchTerm:@"FIND {MyProspect}"];

    ```

This call returns “FIND \\{MyProspect\\}”.

The `sanitizeSOSLSearchTerm` method is called in the implementation of the SOSL and SOQL QueryBuilder methods, so you don’t need to call it on strings that you’re passing to those methods. However, you can use it if, for instance, you’re building your own queries manually. SOSL reserved characters include:

\\ ? & | ! { } [ ] ( ) ^ ~ \* : " ' + -
