# Add Permissions to a Profile

Create a profile that has API Enabled and Enable Chatter permissions.

1.  From Setup, enter `Profiles` in the Quick Find box, then select **Profiles**.

2.  Click **New Profile**.

3.  For Existing Profile select **Customer Community User**.

4.  For **Profile Name** type `FineApps API User`.

5.  Click **Save**.

6.  On the FineApps API User page, click **Edit**.

7.  For **Administrative Permissions** select **API Enabled** and **Enable Chatter**.

    :::note

    A user who doesn’t have the Enable Chatter permission gets an insufficient privileges error immediately after successfully logging into your Experience Cloud site in Salesforce.

8.  Click **Save**.

:::note

In this tutorial we use a profile, but you can also use a permission set that includes the required permissions.
