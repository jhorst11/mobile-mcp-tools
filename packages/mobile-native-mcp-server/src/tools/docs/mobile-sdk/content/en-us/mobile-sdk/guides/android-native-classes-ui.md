# UI Classes

Activities in the `com.salesforce.androidsdk.ui` package represent the UI resources that are common to all Mobile SDK apps. You can style, skin, theme, or otherwise customize these resources through XML. If you override these resources, you’re responsible for maintaining them when Mobile SDK breaks compatibility. With the exceptions of `SalesforceActivity`, `SalesforceListActivity`, and `SalesforceExpandableListActivity`, do not override these activity classes with intentions of replacing the resources at runtime.
