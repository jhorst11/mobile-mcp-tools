# Android Native Quick Start

Use the following procedure to get started quickly.

1.  Make sure you meet all of the [native Android requirements](android-requirements.md).
2.  Install [Mobile SDK for Android](install-android.md). If you prefer, you can install Mobile SDK from the [Mobile SDK GitHub Repositories](install-github.md) instead.
3.  At the command line, run the forcedroid application to create a new [Android project](android-new-project.md), and then run that app in Android Studio or from the command line.
4.  Follow the instructions at [Setting Up Sample Projects in Android Studio](android-project-setup.md).
