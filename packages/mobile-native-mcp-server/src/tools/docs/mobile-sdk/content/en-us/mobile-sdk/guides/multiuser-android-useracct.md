| `public String getOrgLevelStoragePath()`                            | Returns the organization level storage path for this user account, relative to the higher level directory of app data. The higher level directory could be `files`. The output is in the format `/{orgID}/`. This storage path is meant for data that can be shared across multiple users of the same organization.                                                                                                    |
| `public String getUserLevelStoragePath()`                           | Returns the user level storage path for this user account, relative to the higher level directory of app data. The higher level directory could be `files`. The output is in the format `/{orgID}/{userID}/`. This storage path is meant for data that is unique to a particular user in an organization, but common across all the communities that the user is a member of within that organization.                 |
| `public String getCommunityLevelStoragePath(String communityId)`    | Returns the community level storage path for this user account, relative to the higher level directory of app data. The higher level directory could be `files`. The output is in the format `/{orgID}/{userID}/{communityID}/`. If `communityID` is null and then the output would be `/{orgID}/{userID}/internal/`. This storage path is meant for data that is unique to a particular user in a specific community. |
| `public String getOrgLevelFilenameSuffix()`                         | Returns a unique suffix for this user account, that can be appended to a file to uniquely identify this account, at an organization level. The output is in the format `_{orgID}`. This suffix is meant for data that can be shared across multiple users of the same organization.                                                                                                                                    |
| `public String getUserLevelFilenameSuffix()`                        | Returns a unique suffix for this user account, that can be appended to a file to uniquely identify this account, at a user level. The output is in the format `_{orgID}_{userID}`. This suffix is meant for data that is unique to a particular user in an organization, but common across all the communities that the user is a member of within that organization.                                                  |
| `public String getCommunityLevelFilenameSuffix(String communityId)` | Returns a unique suffix for this user account, that can be appended to a file to uniquely identify this account, at a community level. The output is in the format `_{orgID}_{userID}_{communityID}`. If `communityID` is null and then the output would be `_{orgID}_{userID}_internal`. This suffix is meant for data that is unique to a particular user in a specific community.                                   |
