# What Was New in Recent Releases

Here’s an archive of What’s New bulletins from recent Mobile SDK releases.

## Mobile SDK 12.2

Mobile SDK 12.2 is a minor release that features QR code login, visionOS support, refresh behavior enhancements, and modernized support for iOS and Android.

In interim releases, we often deprecate items in native libraries for removal in an upcoming major release. Be sure to check your compiler logs for deprecation warnings so that you can address any changes before they go into effect.

### General Updates

These changes apply to more than one platform.

#### External Component Version Updates 

- React Native: 0.74.5

#### Single Access UI Bridge API

When displaying a Salesforce UI in a webview or external browser without requiring users to reenter their credentials, we now use the Single Access UI Bridge API (UI Bridge API for short) to construct the frontdoor URL, which was previously constructed manually. See also:

- [Supported Salesforce APIs](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/mobile-sdk/guide/ref-rest-api.html)

- [_Salesforce Help_: Generate a Frontdoor URL to Bridge into UI Sessions. ](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.frontdoor_singleaccess.htm&type=5)

#### QR Code Login

With the help of Apex classes, Visualforce Pages, UI Bridge API, and new Mobile SDK methods, we can now log users in with a QR code. To learn more about QR code login and how to set it up, see:

- [QR Code Login with Single Access UI Bridge API](qrcode-login.md)
- [QR Code Login Prerequisites](qrcode-login-prereqs.md)
- [QR Code Login for Android](qrcode-login-android.md)
- [QR Code Login for iOS](qrcode-login-ios.md)

#### Refresh Behavior Enhancements

We enhanced our token refresh behavior for 403 (`Bad_OAuth_Token`) responses. Where apps previously managed a 403 response by performing a preliminary REST call to update the access token, we now refresh the token automatically.

The new refresh behavior impacts the `/service/oauth2` endpoint and helps with our new REST wrapper for [UI Bridge API](#single-access-ui-bridge-api).

### iOS

#### iOS 18 Compatibility 

We successfully tested Mobile SDK for compatibility with iOS 18 and XCode 16. See Apple’s [iOS 18 Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-18-release-notes).

#### visionOS Support

We added support for visionOS. See [Add visionOS as a supported destination for your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/bringing-your-app-to-visionos/#Add-visionOS-as-a-supported-destination-for-your-app) in Apple’s documentation.

#### Deprecated APIs 

Check your compiler warnings, or see [iOS Current Deprecations](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/mobile-sdk/guide/reference-current-deprecations-ios.html).

### Android 

See also: _General Updates in Mobile SDK 12.2_

#### Version Updates 

- Android Gradle Plugin: 8.6.1

#### Login Screen Bug Fix and Breaking Change

We fixed a bug that sometimes caused the login screen to relaunch after a successful authentication.

:::important
This bug fix introduced a breaking change. If your app overrides LoginActivity or uses advanced authentication, change the launch mode from 'singleTop' to 'singleTask'. 
:::

#### Android 15 Compatibility 

We successfully tested Mobile SDK for compatibility with Android 15. See [Android Version 15](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15).

Note: Apps that target SDK 35 on Android 15 now display edge-to-edge. To change the color of the status bar, override the `sf__api_35_status_bar_color` resource.

#### Hybrid Remote Application Session Management 

In hybrid remote applications, we now use session IDs, sourced from the login and refresh token endpoints, to load the app’s start page. This replaces the behavior in previous versions, which relied on a frontdoor URL to establish a UI session.

Note: This feature requires hybrid authentication, which is enabled by default. To verify the hybrid authentication setting, verify that the `useHybridAuthentication` property in `SalesforceSDKManager` is set to `true`.

#### Deprecated APIs

Check your compiler warnings, or see [Android Current Deprecations](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.mobile_sdk.meta/mobile_sdk/reference_current_deprecations_android.htm).

In major releases, we typically remove items that have been deprecated. To learn about new features and breaking changes that can affect your app, read the rest of this article. In every release, be sure to check your compiler logs for deprecation warnings so that you can address these changes before they go into effect.

### General Updates

These changes apply to more than one platform.

#### Native Login

We added native login support for Experience Cloud sites, including passwordless login. See also:

- [Native Login for Experience Cloud](native-login-experience-cloud.md)
- [Native Passwordless Login](native-login-passwordless.md)

#### Encrypted Push Notifications Change

Starting in Summer 2024, we use a new cipher mode for encrypting push notifications on the server.

- The server only understands the new cipher mode after Summer 2025.
- Mobile apps using Mobile SDK 12.0 can handle both the legacy and new cipher mode.

In interim releases, we often deprecate items in native libraries for removal in an upcoming major release. Be sure to check your compiler logs for deprecation warnings so that you can address any changes before they go into effect.

### General Updates

These changes apply to more than one platform.

#### External Component Version Updates

- Cordova for Android: 12.0.1

- Cordova for iOS: 7.0.1

- React Native: 0.70.14

### iOS

#### iOS 17 Compatibility

We’ve successfully tested Mobile SDK for compatibility with iOS 17 and XCode 15. See [iOS 17 Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-17-release-notes).

#### Swift Package Manager Support

We’ve introduced support for Swift Package Manager, which can now be used to bring Mobile SDK into applications.

- Binary Frameworks for Mobile SDK are hosted on a new repository: <https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS-SPM>.

- We’ve added a `iOSNativeSwiftPackageManager` template, which pulls its dependencies through Swift Package Manager.

- See also: [Add Mobile SDK Libraries to Your Project](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/mobile-sdk/guide/ios-new-native-manual-clone-sdk.html), [Creating an iOS Swift Project Manually](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/mobile-sdk/guide/ios-new-native-project-manual.html), [Creating an iOS Project with Forceios](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/mobile-sdk/guide/ios-new-force-project.html).

#### Deprecated APIs

Check your compiler warnings, or see [iOS Current Deprecations](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/mobile-sdk/guide/reference-current-deprecations-ios.html).

### Android

#### Android 14 Compatibility

We successfully tested Mobile SDK for compatibility with Android 14. See [Android Version 14](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14).

#### Mobile Sync Library Modernization

We modernized the Mobile Sync Library on Android.

- All source files are now written in Kotlin.

- Parameters and members now use non-nullable types wherever nulls aren’t expected or supported.

- Kotlin syntax is now supported where appropriate. For example: string templates, `?:`, `let`, `also`, `map`, `forEach`, `when`, etc.

- Co-routine wrappers are now available for key methods in SyncManager. See [Incremental Syncs with reSync](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/mobile-sdk/guide/entity-framework-native-inc-sync.html), [Handling “Ghost” Records After Sync Down Operations](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/mobile-sdk/guide/entity-framework-sync-ghosts.html), [Using Sync Names](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/mobile-sdk/guide/entity-framework-name-based-apis.html).

:::note
Although we don’t typically require consuming code changes in minor releases such as Mobile SDK 11.1, our modernized Mobile Sync library requires consuming code changes in some cases. For example, constants that were once imported from a class in Java are now imported from a companion object in consuming Kotlin code.
:::

#### Android Template Updates

- Our Mobile SDK Android templates are now up to date with the Kotlin DSL migration.

- Our templates are now set up to download Mobile SDK artifacts from Maven Central, which results in a friendlier build environment.

#### Advanced Authentication Enhancements

We fixed these bugs related to advanced auth.

- If Chrome wasn’t found during the advanced auth flow, Android users were presented with an error and couldn’t continue with login. Advanced authentication now reinstates the expected behavior of using the default browser if Chrome isn’t available at runtime.

- A bug caused some Android users’ login flow to reset to the initial screen when the app was backgrounded during MFA. We’ve fixed this issue and changed LoginActivity’s launch mode from `singleInstance` to `singleTop`. Apps that extend LoginActivity now require the same change.

We added new advanced auth methods that allow you to 1) configure which browser your app selects and 2) view the currently selected custom tab browser. See [Configuring Advanced Authentication in Android Apps](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/platform/mobile-sdk/guide/auth-android-advanced.html).

#### Deprecated APIs

Check your compiler warnings, or see [Android Current Deprecations](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.mobile_sdk.meta/mobile_sdk/reference_current_deprecations_android.htm).

Read the following information to learn about new features and breaking changes that can affect your app. In every release, be sure to check your compiler logs for deprecation warnings so that you can address these changes before they go into effect.

### General Updates

These changes apply to more than one platform.

- The default authentication on iOS and Android now uses Web Server Flow instead of User-Agent Flow. See [OAuth 2.0 Web Server Flow](oauth-web-server-flow.md).
- Device system biometric authentication for logins. See [Biometric Authentication](biometric-auth.md).
- Reworked multi-app SSO flows and configurations with identity providers. See [Identity Provider Apps](auth-identity-providers.md).

## Mobile SDK 9.2.0

Mobile SDK 9.2.0 is an interim release that features non-breaking API changes and modernized iOS support.

In interim releases, we often deprecate items in native libraries for removal in an upcoming major release. Be sure to check your compiler logs for deprecation warnings so that you can address any changes before they go into effect.

These changes apply to more than one platform.

### General Updates

- Passcode Removal

  - : We’ve removed app-specific passcodes from iOS and Android apps in favor of mobile operating system security. Mobile SDK still honors an org’s passcode requirement but ignores passcode length, passcode timeout, and biometric settings from a connected app. For customers who’ve already configured a device lock screen or biometric unlock, this upgrade is seamless. For others, the new app lock screen prompts the customer to configure an authentication mode. When the customer reactivates the app from the background, the device passcode, rather than an app-specific passcode, is required. See [About Login and Passcodes](ios-native-login-passcodes.md) (iOS) and [Using Passcodes](android-passcodes.md) (Android).

### External Component Version Updates

- Cordova

  - :
    - iOS: 6.2.0

- REST API Wrapper Update

  - :
    - We’ve added a `batchSize` parameter to `requestForQuery` methods of `SFRestApi` (Objective-C) and `RestClient` (Swift). Use this parameter to specify a preferred number of records to be returned in each fetch. Permissible values range from 200 to 2,000 (default setting). To allow for run-time performance adjustments, Mobile SDK doesn’t guarantee that your requested size will be the actual batch size.

    - We’ve added a `batchSize` parameter to the `RestRequest.getRequestForQuery` method. Use this parameter to specify a preferred number of records to be returned in each fetch. Permissible values range from 200 to 2,000 (default setting). To allow for run-time performance adjustments, Mobile SDK doesn’t guarantee that your requested size will be the actual batch size.

- SmartStore

### Mobile Sync

- SOQL Sync Down Target Enhancement

  - : You can now configure the size for SOQL sync down batches. You can specify any value from 200 to 2,000 (default value). See [Using the SOQL Sync Down Target](entity-framework-sync-down-target-soql.md).
