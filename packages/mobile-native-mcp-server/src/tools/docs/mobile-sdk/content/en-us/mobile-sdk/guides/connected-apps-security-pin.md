# About PIN Security

Beginning in version 9.2, Mobile SDK uses the mobile device PIN instead of an app-specific PIN and simplifies the passcode flow.

- For iOS, see [About Login and Passcodes](ios-native-login-passcodes.md).
- For Android, see [Using Passcodes](android-passcodes.md).

<!-- To illustrate how PIN protection works:

1.  Customer turns on a phone and enters the PIN for the device.
2.  Customer launches a Mobile SDK app.
3.  Customer enters login information for a Salesforce org.
4.  Customer works in the app and then sends it to the background by opening another app (or receiving a call, and so on).
5.  The app times out.
6.  Customer reopens the app, and the PIN screen displays.
7.  Customer enters the device PIN or creates one if none exists.
8.  Customer can resume working.
