Hybrid apps use SmartStore functions defined in the `force.js` library. In this example, the click handler for the Fetch Contacts button calls `force.query()` to send a simple SOQL query ("`SELECT Name, Id FROM Contact`") to Salesforce. This call designates `onSuccessSfdcContacts(response)` as the callback function that receives the REST response. The `onSuccessSfdcContacts(response)` function iterates through the returned records in response and populates UI controls with Salesforce values. Finally, it upserts all records from the response into the sample soup.
