# Using Experience Cloud Sites With Mobile SDK Apps

Experience Cloud sites can include up to millions of users, as allowed by [Salesforce limits](https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=limits_communities_parent.htm). With proper configuration, your customers can use their Experience Cloud site login credentials to access your Mobile SDK app. You can also brand your Experience Cloud site and login screen.

To learn more about Experience Cloud sites, see [Set Up and Manage Experience Cloud Sites](https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=networks_overview.htm) in Salesforce Help.
