# High-Level Project Design

## Vision: Democratizing Native Mobile Development

For too long, mobile app development has forced an artificial choice between optimal user experience and development accessibility. Customers who want the responsive, intuitive, and engaging experience that only native mobile apps provide have been constrained by a "development skill tax"—the penalty paid in time, complexity, and expertise required to build truly excellent mobile experiences.

This paradigm made sense in the pre-generative-AI era, when technical complexity genuinely required specialized human expertise to navigate. However, with the advent of generative AI and agentic technology, we now have the tools to level this playing field. When customers are freed from technical constraints and asked what kind of mobile experience they truly want, the answer is overwhelmingly clear: the most responsive, attention-holding, intuitive, and productivity-enhancing experience possible. These experiences are optimally delivered through native mobile applications.

**The complexities of native mobile development are real and substantial.** Platform-specific toolchains, SDK integrations, build systems, and deployment workflows create multiplicative complexity far beyond the comparatively more straightforward approaches of e.g. mobile web development. This genuine technical complexity established a legitimate barrier to entry that was beyond most customers' reach.

Yet these technical hurdles need not be insurmountable for aspiring app creators. Through the skillful deployment of generative AI and agentic systems, we can make sophisticated native development accessible to anyone who can describe what they want to build. The underlying complexity remains—but it can be elegantly managed by expert systems that translate vision into implementation.

### The Agentic Mobile Development Revolution

This MCP server represents a fundamental shift in how mobile applications are created. Rather than forcing developers to master platform-specific expertise, complex toolchains, and intricate SDK integrations, we enable them to describe what they want to build in natural language and receive production-ready native mobile applications.

This isn't about replacing developers—it's about **eliminating artificial constraints** that have historically forced compromise between development feasibility and user experience quality. When agentic AI handles the technical complexity, developers can focus entirely on specifying desired outcomes while the system generates optimal implementations.

### From Intent to Impact: Four Transformative Shifts

Our vision rests on four fundamental transformations that redefine mobile developer experience:

1. **Machine-Actionable Documentation**: Documentation becomes executable intelligence—structured, tagged, and context-rich so AI assistants can reason about and act upon it, transforming more open-ended prompts into real project scaffolding

2. **Intent-Orchestrated Development**: Existing CLI tools and SDKs become composable building blocks orchestrated by natural language intent, with AI assistants acting as intelligent command planners

3. **IDE as Intelligent Partner**: Development environments transform from editors to guides, delivering contextual assistance, setup automation, and next-step suggestions exactly when and where needed

4. **Apps That Provide Live Feedback**: Generated applications provide immediate, structured runtime feedback to app developers, enabling fast iteration cycles and experience-driven decision making as they refine their mobile experiences

### The Ultimate Goal: Removing the Development Skill Tax

When we eliminate the artificial barriers between intent and implementation, we unlock a new class of mobile app creators who can build sophisticated native experiences without mastering specialized technical skills. Customers no longer sacrifice user experience quality for development feasibility—they simply describe what they want to build and receive the optimal implementation.

This transformation democratizes access to the pinnacle of mobile user experience while preserving the full power and sophistication of existing mobile development ecosystems. We're not replacing professional mobile development—we're making its capabilities accessible to anyone who can articulate their vision.

**The future of mobile development shifts the starting point from "figure it out" to "build what you imagined."**

## Core Design Principles

1. **Machine-Actionable Documentation**: Template metadata and extension guidance that LLMs can reason about and act upon
2. **Intent-Orchestrated CLIs**: Existing Force CLI tools become composable building blocks orchestrated by natural language intent
3. **IDE as Guide**: The development environment becomes an intelligent partner that transforms intent into working software
4. **Apps That Talk Back**: Generated applications provide immediate user experience feedback to developers, enabling fast iteration cycles and experience-driven refinement

### Agentic Philosophy: LLM-Led Execution

**Let LLMs drive creativity and decision-making.** We optimize for agentic flows that guide LLMs to act directly, especially where automation through code would constrain adaptability or be too costly to maintain. MCP tools should primarily provide context, constraints, and next-step guidance, enabling the LLM to plan and execute tasks end-to-end.

- **Guide, don’t over-abstract**: Prefer information-forward tools that teach the LLM how to proceed rather than doing everything on its behalf.
- **Enable self-healing**: Preserve access to raw outputs (stdout/stderr, exit codes, JSON) from downstream tools so the LLM can diagnose and recover from errors.
- **Use guardrails sparingly**: Add algorithmic guardrails only where correctness or safety requires deterministic behavior.

### Treat LLMs as Counterparts to Humans

We design agentic interactions as if LLMs have the same knowledge expectations and call-to-action requirements as human developers.

- **Human-parity tasking**: Instruct LLMs the way we would instruct humans; collaborate and iterate to reach the desired outcome.
- **Leverage existing IP and workflows**: Favor tools, docs, and CLIs already used by humans so we can reuse proven assets and cover existing use cases with minimal refactoring.
- **Consistency of interfaces**: Documentation, help systems, and CLI UX should remain useful to both humans and LLMs.

### Machine-Actionable Documentation and Metadata

**Philosophy**: "Don't build tools, tell the LLM how to use what we already have."

**From Human-Readable to Machine-Actionable**: Documentation isn't just for humans—it's structured, tagged, and context-rich so LLMs can reason about and act upon it. We recognize that documentation exists in multiple forms throughout the development ecosystem:

- **Public Development Guides**: Official customer-facing documentation including development guides, best practices, tutorials, and architectural patterns
- **API Documentation**: Richly-described TypeScript declaration files, DocC comments (iOS), KDoc documentation (Android), and inline code documentation that provides semantic context about functionality and usage
- **Self-Describing CLI Tools**: Command-line interfaces that expose their capabilities, parameters, and usage patterns through built-in help systems and structured output formats

We embrace and extend all of these documentation outlets as sources of rich, contextual information that can guide agentic decision-making and provide prescriptive workflows for complex development scenarios.

- **Rich Template Metadata**: Each mobile SDK template includes comprehensive, structured documentation that goes beyond basic descriptions. This includes not only _what_ the template provides, but _how_ it works—covering design considerations, architectural decisions, extension scenarios, upgrade paths, common pitfalls, and integration patterns
- **Embedded Complete Examples**: Verifiable code examples that demonstrate exact implementation patterns
- **Clear Requirements and Dependencies**: Structured information about platform, version, prerequisites, and dependencies that can be programmatically validated
- **Documentation Grounding**: All guidance stems from official Salesforce documentation across all sources—public development guides, SDK API documentation, CLI tool specifications, and code-level documentation—ensuring accuracy and best practices while being machine-interpretable and actionable

**Enabling LLM Agency Through Knowledge**: This comprehensive documentation ecosystem enables sophisticated LLM autonomy and resilience:

- **Guided Autonomy**: Rich contextual information allows the LLM to make informed implementation decisions while staying grounded in best practices
- **Error Recovery**: When issues arise, comprehensive documentation provides the knowledge base for the LLM to adapt and self-correct rather than failing due to insufficient context
- **Adaptive Problem-Solving**: The LLM maintains the ability to reason through unexpected scenarios by drawing upon the full spectrum of available documentation and examples

### Assistant as Intelligent Guide

**Principle**: The assistant should be where the real developer experience begins—not just code generation, but understanding, suggesting, and adapting, wherever developers choose to work.

**From Tool to Partner**: The AI assistant becomes an intelligent guide that turns developer intent into working software by stitching together documentation, tools, and SDKs, meeting developers in their preferred environment.

- **Contextual Guidance**: All necessary documentation, setup instructions, and troubleshooting guidance delivered directly through the assistant interface, regardless of the developer's chosen environment
- **Environment Orchestration**: Comprehensive validation and intelligent setup of required tools (Xcode, Force CLI, simulators) orchestrated by the assistant across any development context
- **Adaptive Configuration**: Step-by-step mobile-specific OAuth and connected app configuration guidance delivered exactly when and where needed, whether in an IDE, terminal, or other development environment
- **Next-Step Suggestions**: The assistant doesn't just generate code—it suggests logical next steps based on current context and project state, maintaining continuity across different interaction modes
- **Real-Time Adaptation**: The assistant adapts its guidance based on the specific template, features being implemented, and current project configuration

### Intent-Orchestrated CLIs

**Philosophy**: CLI functionality provides the algorithmic foundation, removing the burden of imagination from agents for predictable tasks and freeing them to focus on complex feature integration.

**Division of Labor**: CLIs handle the algorithmically repeatable, well-defined operations while agents focus on the creative, feature-specific challenges that require reasoning and adaptation.

- **Algorithmic Foundation**: Leverage CLI tools (`forceios`, `forcedroid`) for deterministic, repeatable operations like project generation, dependency setup, and file templating
- **Predictable Scaffolding**: Use CLIs to establish the proven, tested structural foundation that agents can confidently build upon
- **Agent Focus on Value**: By offloading repetitive, algorithmic tasks to CLIs, agents can concentrate on the complex work of feature integration, user experience design, and adaptive problem-solving
- **Intelligent Orchestration**: Agents determine when and how to invoke CLI operations based on user intent, but rely on CLI precision for execution
- **Deterministic Base + Creative Extension**: Start with CLI-generated, working foundations, then layer agent-driven features and customizations on top
- **Error-Resistant Foundation**: CLIs provide tested, reliable base functionality, reducing the surface area where agents need to handle edge cases

#### CLIs Are the APIs for LLMs

We treat command-line interfaces as the primary “APIs” that LLMs will use to achieve algorithmic execution within broader, creative workflows.

- **Self-contained execution**: CLIs encapsulate their technology stacks, minimizing environment orchestration burden on the LLM.
- **Declarative inputs**: Command-line arguments supply the salient configuration the LLM needs without exposing internal implementation details.
- **Self-describing**: LLMs can query `--help` (and prefer `--json` when available) to learn capabilities and parameters without human intervention.
- **Human-aligned**: CLIs mirror how human counterparts accomplish the same outcomes, reinforcing the “LLMs as teammates” model.

#### Tool Design Mode

- **Instruction-First Tools (Tell the LLM how to work)**: Tools return steps, commands, arguments, file paths, and references to documentation; the LLM executes and reasons, maintaining agency and adaptability. This project is intentionally focused on this mode—tools direct the LLM to the right CLI(s), arguments, and docs rather than hiding execution behind automation through code.

- **Surface raw outputs**: When instruction-first tools advise CLI usage and the LLM executes them, preserve stdout/stderr, exit codes, and structured outputs for self-healing.
- **Automate only when necessary**: Add deterministic checks or automation only for safety-critical, compliance-bound, or highly repetitive operations.
- **Exploit self-describing CLIs (instruction-first context)**: Encourage discovery via `--help` and machine-readable flags so guidance stays thin and resilient to change.

## Three-Phase Workflow Architecture

### Workflow Overview

The three-phase workflow follows this pattern:

- **Plan phase** runs once during initial setup (includes template instantiation and connected app configuration)
- **Design/Iterate phase** can run multiple times across sequential user sessions (includes feature implementation and testing)
- **Run phase** is incorporated within Design/Iterate for validation and iteration

### Phase Workflow and Checkpoints

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant PlanPhase as Plan Phase
    participant DesignPhase as Design/Iterate Phase
    participant RunPhase as Run Phase

    User->>PlanPhase: Initial app request
    PlanPhase->>PlanPhase: Environment setup
    PlanPhase->>PlanPhase: Template selection
    PlanPhase->>PlanPhase: Connected app inputs
    PlanPhase->>PlanPhase: Create skeletal project
    PlanPhase->>RunPhase: Deploy & validate login
    RunPhase->>User: CHECKPOINT: Functioning skeletal app
    User->>DesignPhase: Feature requirements + feedback

    loop Design/Iterate Cycle
        DesignPhase->>DesignPhase: Implement features
        DesignPhase->>DesignPhase: Build updated project
        DesignPhase->>RunPhase: Deploy & validate features
        RunPhase->>User: CHECKPOINT: Feature validation
        alt User satisfied
            User->>User: End cycle
        else User needs refinement
            User->>DesignPhase: Refinement feedback
        end
    end
```

#### Checkpoint: Post-Plan Phase

By the end of the Plan phase, a functioning skeletal mobile app project must be in place. This checkpoint validates:

1. **Build Validation**: Ensure project builds successfully
2. **Runtime Validation**: Launch app in virtual device using Run phase tools
3. **Login Verification**: Ensure user can successfully login to the functioning app
4. **User Feedback Collection**: Prompt user for feedback to carry into Design/Iterate phase

#### Checkpoint: Post-Design/Iterate Phase

By the end of each Design/Iterate phase, the user validates implemented features:

1. **Build Validation**: Ensure updated project builds successfully
2. **Feature Deployment**: Deploy app to virtual device using Run phase tools
3. **Feature Validation**: User reviews implemented features in running app
4. **Satisfaction Check**: User determines if features meet requirements
   - **If satisfied**: End phase cycle
   - **If refinement needed**: Collect feedback and repeat Design/Iterate phase

### Phase 1: Plan

**Objective**: Establish environment and create functioning skeletal mobile app project.

#### Environment Setup

- Validate required development tools for chosen mobile platform using `@salesforce/lwc-dev-mobile-core` CLI plugin
- Leverage existing `sf force lightning local setup` command environment checks
- _Note: CLI plugin requires updates to support structured JSON output via `--json` flag_

#### Template Selection

- Determine optimal `forceios` or `forcedroid` project template based on user requirements
- Templates sourced from existing SalesforceMobileSDK-Templates repo or new template collection
- **CLI Enhancements Required**:
  - Support for template collection URIs in `forceios` and `forcedroid`
  - Collection-level metadata for template registry/directory
  - Template-specific metadata for self-describing projects

#### Template Metadata System

- **Collection Metadata**: Descriptive directory enabling LLM template selection
- **Template Metadata**: Rich project information including:
  - Nature of implemented features
  - Design and implementation considerations
- **Local Access**: All templates and metadata available locally per documentation repository approach
- _Note: Metadata system design details TBD_

#### Connected App Configuration

- Gather required Connected App Client ID and Callback URI
- Essential inputs for baseline mobile app project creation

#### Project Creation and Setup

- **Template-Based Project Generation**: Guide LLM through using `forceios`/`forcedroid` CLI tools to generate boilerplate app projects from Mobile SDK templates through keyword substitution
- **Connected App Integration**: Direct LLM to configure OAuth parameters in generated project files using provided Connected App credentials via CLI tool parameters
- **Dependency Configuration**: Instruct LLM on ensuring generated projects include properly configured CocoaPods/Swift Package Manager (iOS) or Gradle (Android) dependencies
- **Ready-to-Build Foundation**: Guide LLM to verify CLI output creates immediately buildable projects using native platform build systems

### Phase 2: Design/Iterate

**Objective**: Transform user requirements into working features through iterative development cycles with continuous validation.

#### Pre-Conditions

- List of user requirements from initial utterance
- Functioning mobile app project based on selected Mobile SDK template that builds and deploys successfully
- User can login to launched app on virtual devices

#### Core Facility: Changelog System

- **Iteration Tracking**: Create sequential Markdown documents (`changelog-1.md`, `changelog-2.md`, etc.) in `changelog/` folder within mobile app project
- **Changelog Content**:
  - Date/time of change
  - User-consumable summary of iteration changes
  - Rationale for significant design decisions
  - **Structured Metadata** (machine-readable while preserving user readability):
    - `task_scope`: Brief categorization (e.g., "new_feature", "refactor", "bug_fix", "ui_enhancement")
    - `complexity_level`: Task complexity rating (e.g., "simple", "moderate", "complex")
    - `affected_components`: List of major code areas modified
    - `dependencies`: Tasks or features this iteration depends on
    - `validation_criteria`: Specific success criteria for the task
- **Purpose**: Provide chronological history and reasoning for future LLM iterations to inform decision-making

#### Workflow

**Goal**: Break work into reasonably-scoped tasks to ensure high quality and adherence to user requirements.

1. **Task Planning**
   - Analyze user feature utterances, local documentation store, and previous changelog docs
   - Create sequential/iterative task list to execute user requirements
   - Each task completion results in buildable and deployable app state
   - **Task Granularity Guidance**: MCP tools provide LLM with task sizing recommendations and execution strategies:
     - **Simple tasks**: Single UI component, basic configuration change, simple data model update, single file modifications
       - _Approach_: Execute as single atomic operation with immediate validation
       - _Validation_: Build, deploy, verify single feature works as expected
     - **Moderate tasks**: Feature integration, API endpoint implementation, complex UI workflow, multi-file coordinated changes
       - _Approach_: Break into 2-3 sub-steps, validate each step incrementally within the task
       - _Validation_: Build after each sub-step, deploy and test complete feature functionality
     - **Complex tasks**: Multi-component features, major architectural changes, cross-platform implementations, extensive refactoring
       - _Approach_: Decompose into 3-5 smaller tasks instead of executing as single complex task
       - _Execution_: Insert decomposed tasks at top of task list, adjust remaining tasks as needed
     - **Avoid**: Tasks affecting >3 major code areas simultaneously or requiring fundamental architecture changes
       - _Execution_: Always decompose into multiple moderate or simple tasks, insert at top of task list

2. **Iterative Task Execution** (Loop for tasks 1 to n)
   - **Execute Task**: Update mobile app project for current task
   - **Test Implementation**: Add/amend unit tests to validate implemented functionality
   - **Document Changes**: Create next sequential changelog file with structured metadata
   - **Validate Build**: Build and launch app with project changes
   - **Error Handling**: If build fails or critical issues arise:
     - Attempt immediate recovery through iterative fixes
     - If recovery impossible: rollback to previous "good" state and treat as fatal workflow error
     - Cease further task processing on fatal errors
   - **User Review**: Report task completion with tri-state feedback prompt:
     - _"I've completed [feature description]. Would you like to make changes? Or otherwise, would you like me to keep going with the next round of changes?"_
   - **Dynamic Task List Management**: Handle all task list adjustments through unified mechanism:
     - **User Feedback (Option A)**: Evaluate requested changes → insert new tasks at top of list → adjust remaining tasks
     - **Task Decomposition**: Complex task identified → decompose into smaller tasks → insert at top of list → adjust remaining tasks
     - **Error Recovery**: Build failure requiring fixes → insert recovery tasks at top of list → adjust remaining tasks
     - **Continue Execution (Option B)**: No adjustments needed → continue to next task in current list
     - **Stop Processing (Option C)**: Complete current iteration cycle → exit to post-iteration checkpoint

#### Integrated Build Process

Build capabilities are embedded throughout the Design/Iterate phase rather than being a separate phase:

- **Continuous Build Validation**: Guide LLM through build verification using native platform build tools (Xcode for iOS, Gradle for Android) after every task completion
- **Build-First Approach**: Direct LLM to validate code changes through platform build process before user review
- **Native Build System Integration**: Provide LLM with Xcode compilation/linking (iOS) and Gradle compilation/packaging (Android) command guidance
- **Build Error Recovery**: Instruct LLM on error recovery task insertion using unified task list management when build failures occur
- **CLI Tool Separation**: Guide LLM to use `forceios`/`forcedroid` for project generation only; build validation uses native platform tooling

**Build Workflow Integration:**

1. **Task Implementation** → **Native Platform Build** → **Build Validation** → **Deploy & Test** → **User Review**
2. **Build Failure** → **Error Analysis** → **Recovery Task Generation** → **Task List Insertion** → **Retry Build**

#### Task Scoping Principles

- Focus on one feature set iteration at a time
- Maintain app in buildable/deployable state after each task
- Enable continuous user validation and feedback integration

### Phase 3: Run

**Overall Goal**: Provide developers with fast feedback on their app changes by building, deploying, and launching to virtual devices, enabling quick assessment of implementation details and user experience-driven iteration.

**Core Functionality**: Guide LLM through leveraging existing CLI tooling to rapidly deploy app projects to configured virtual devices (iOS simulator, Android emulator), allowing developers to immediately see and interact with their changes.

- **CLI-Driven Deployment**: Direct LLM to utilize the `@salesforce/lwc-dev-mobile` Salesforce CLI plugin to launch app projects to virtual devices
- **Fast Feedback Loop**: Provide LLM with methods to enable immediate visual and interactive feedback on implementation changes, supporting experience-driven decision making
- **Virtual Device Integration**: Guide LLM through seamless deployment to iOS simulators and Android emulators for rapid testing and validation
- **User Experience Focus**: Direct LLM to prioritize developer assessment of user experience and interface changes over automated debugging
- **Iterative Validation**: Instruct LLM on quick build-deploy-test cycles that inform the next round of Design/Iterate phase improvements

**Implementation Details**: The CLI tooling functionality exists but requires restoration, as `@salesforce/lwc-dev-mobile` is currently deprecated and sparsely documented. The MCP server tools will guide the LLM through this CLI plugin usage to enable virtual device deployment.

### Real-Time Documentation Access: Simple Document Store with Section Selectors

**Architecture Decision**: Implement a minimal documentation storage system where each MCP tool knows exactly which document and section it needs, eliminating complex lookup logic while maintaining local reliability.

#### Simple Documentation System Architecture

The documentation facility consists of two core components:

```typescript
// Minimal Documentation System
interface DocumentationSystem {
  documentStore: SimpleDocumentStore;
  updateManager: DocumentUpdateManager;
}
```

#### Document Configuration Schema

**Simple Document Storage**: Each MCP server lists the documents it needs, and each tool knows exactly which section to extract:

```typescript
interface DocumentationConfig {
  mcpServerName: string;
  documents: DocumentSource[];
  toolMappings: ToolDocumentMapping[];
  updateFrequency: UpdateFrequency;
}

interface DocumentSource {
  id: string; // Unique identifier for this document
  name: string; // Human-readable name
  url: string; // Source URL
  type: 'html' | 'markdown';
}

// Each tool maps to one or more document sections
interface ToolDocumentMapping {
  toolName: string; // e.g., "createiOSProject"
  documents: DocumentReference[]; // Can reference multiple documents/sections
  description: string; // What this documentation provides
}

interface DocumentReference {
  documentId: string; // References DocumentSource.id
  selector?: string; // CSS selector for HTML, simple path for Markdown. If omitted, returns whole document
  label?: string; // Optional label for this document section (e.g., "CLI Commands", "Authentication Setup")
}

// Example configuration for mobile-native MCP server (initial focus)
const mobileNativeDocsConfig: DocumentationConfig = {
  mcpServerName: 'sfdc-mobile-native-mcp-server',
  documents: [
    {
      id: 'forceios-cli-reference',
      name: 'Force iOS CLI Reference',
      url: 'https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.mobile_sdk.meta/mobile_sdk/native_ios_tools_forceios.htm',
      type: 'html',
    },
    {
      id: 'forcedroid-cli-reference',
      name: 'Force Android CLI Reference',
      url: 'https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.mobile_sdk.meta/mobile_sdk/native_android_tools_forcedroid.htm',
      type: 'html',
    },
    {
      id: 'mobile-auth-setup',
      name: 'Mobile SDK Authentication Setup',
      url: 'https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.mobile_sdk.meta/mobile_sdk/oauth_setup.htm',
      type: 'html',
    },
    {
      id: 'mobile-templates',
      name: 'Mobile SDK Template Overview',
      url: 'https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.mobile_sdk.meta/mobile_sdk/native_templates.htm',

      documents: [
        {
          documentId: 'forceios-cli-reference',
          selector: '.main .create-section',
          label: 'CLI Commands',
        },
        {
          documentId: 'mobile-templates',
          selector: '.ios-templates',
          label: 'iOS Templates',
        },
      ],
      description:
        'Instructions for creating iOS projects using forceios CLI and available templates',
    },
    {
      toolName: 'createAndroidProject',
      documents: [

        },
        {
          documentId: 'mobile-templates',
          selector: '.android-templates',
          label: 'Android Templates',
        },
      ],
      description:
        'Instructions for creating Android projects using forcedroid CLI and available templates',
    },
    {
      toolName: 'configureAuthentication',
      documents: [
        {
          documentId: 'mobile-auth-setup',
          // No selector - returns whole document
          label: 'Complete Authentication Guide',
        },
      ],
      description: 'Complete OAuth and connected app configuration guide',
    },
    {
      toolName: 'selectProjectTemplate',
      documents: [
        {
          documentId: 'mobile-templates',
          selector: '.template-options',
          label: 'Template Options',
        },
      ],
      description: 'Available project templates and their use cases',
    },
  ],
  updateFrequency: 'weekly',
};
```

#### Simple Document Storage

**Minimal Processing**: Store whole documents in their native format and parse sections at runtime:

```typescript
interface SimpleDocumentStore {
  storeDocument(document: StoredDocument): Promise<void>;
  getDocument(documentId: string): Promise<StoredDocument | null>;
  getDocumentSection(documentId: string, selector?: string): Promise<string>;
  updateDocument(documentId: string, content: string): Promise<void>;
  listDocuments(): Promise<StoredDocument[]>;
}

interface StoredDocument {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  url: string;
  type: 'html' | 'markdown';
  content: string; // Raw HTML or Markdown content
  lastUpdated: Date;
}

// Built-in parsers for extracting sections
interface DocumentParser {
  extractSection(content: string, selector?: string): string;
}

class HtmlParser implements DocumentParser {
  extractSection(htmlContent: string, cssSelector?: string): string {
    if (!cssSelector) {
      return htmlContent; // Return whole document if no selector
    }
    // Use standard HTML parsing (e.g., jsdom) with CSS selectors
    // Returns the matched section as text/HTML
  }
}

class MarkdownParser implements DocumentParser {
  extractSection(markdownContent: string, pathSelector?: string): string {
    if (!pathSelector) {
      return markdownContent; // Return whole document if no selector
    }
    // Simple path-based selection for Markdown
    // e.g., "## Getting Started > ### Installation"
    // Returns the matched section as Markdown/text
  }
}
```

**Key Principles**:

- **Whole Document Storage**: Each document stored as a single database row in native format
- **Runtime Parsing**: Tools parse and extract sections when needed, not during ingestion
- **Built-in Parsers**: HTML and Markdown parsers included in the MCP server package
- **Flexible Tool Access**: Each tool can access one or more documents, with optional section selectors
- **Optional Selectors**: Tools can get whole documents (no selector) or specific sections (with selector)

#### Tool Interface for Documentation Access

**Direct Document Access**: Each tool accesses exactly the documentation section it needs:

```typescript
// Simple service that tools use to get their documentation
class DocumentationService {
  constructor(
    private documentStore: SimpleDocumentStore,
    private config: DocumentationConfig
  ) {}

  async getDocumentationForTool(toolName: string): Promise<ToolDocumentation> {
    // Find the mapping for this tool
    const mapping = this.config.toolMappings.find(m => m.toolName === toolName);
    if (!mapping) {
      throw new Error(`No documentation mapping found for tool: ${toolName}`);
    }

    // Get all document sections for this tool
    const sections = await Promise.all(
      mapping.documents.map(async docRef => {
        const content = await this.documentStore.getDocumentSection(
          docRef.documentId,
          docRef.selector
        );
        return {
          content,
          label: docRef.label || docRef.documentId,
          documentId: docRef.documentId,
        };
      })
    );

    return {
      sections,
      description: mapping.description,
    };
  }
}

interface ToolDocumentation {
  sections: DocumentationSection[];
  description: string;
}

interface DocumentationSection {
  content: string;
  label: string;
  documentId: string;
}
```

**Storage Implementation**:

- **SQLite Database**: Local, file-based storage for simplicity and reliability
- **Single Table**: Documents stored as rows with `id`, `content`, `type`, `url`, `lastUpdated`
- **Shared Database**: Single database shared across all MCP tools in the server
- **Local Deployment**: Self-contained storage within MCP server installations
- **No External Dependencies**: Standard Node.js libraries (SQLite, jsdom for HTML parsing)

#### Example Tool Implementation

**Simple Tool Usage**: Each tool directly gets its required documentation section:

```typescript
// Example MCP tool implementation
class CreateiOSProjectTool {
  constructor(private documentationService: DocumentationService) {}

  async execute(requirements: ProjectRequirements): Promise<ToolResult> {
    // Tool gets all its configured documentation sections
    const docs = await this.documentationService.getDocumentationForTool('createiOSProject');

    // Format multiple sections into response
    const formattedDocs = docs.sections
      .map(section => `## ${section.label}\n\n${section.content}`)
      .join('\n\n');

    return {
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: `To create your iOS project, follow these steps:

${formattedDocs}

Based on your requirements:
- Project name: ${requirements.name}
- Template: ${requirements.template}
- Platform: iOS

Run the following command:
\`\`\`bash
forceios create --name ${requirements.name} --template ${requirements.template}
\`\`\`

Next steps: ${this.generateNextSteps(requirements)}`,
        },
      ],
    };
  }
}

class ConfigureAuthenticationTool {
  constructor(private documentationService: DocumentationService) {}

  async execute(): Promise<ToolResult> {
    // Gets the whole authentication document (no selector configured)
    const docs = await this.documentationService.getDocumentationForTool('configureAuthentication');

    return {
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: `To configure authentication for your mobile app:

${docs.sections[0].content}

Make sure to save your Connected App consumer key and callback URL for the next steps.`,
        },
      ],
    };
  }
}
```

#### Document Update Manager

**Simple Update Process**: Periodically fetch fresh documentation from sources:

```typescript
interface DocumentUpdateManager {
  updateDocument(documentId: string, url: string): Promise<void>;
  updateAllDocuments(config: DocumentationConfig): Promise<void>;
}

class SimpleUpdateManager implements DocumentUpdateManager {
  constructor(private documentStore: SimpleDocumentStore) {}

  async updateDocument(documentId: string, url: string): Promise<void> {
    // Fetch fresh content from URL
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const content = await response.text();

    // Store updated document
    await this.documentStore.updateDocument(documentId, content);
  }

  async updateAllDocuments(config: DocumentationConfig): Promise<void> {
    for (const doc of config.documents) {
      await this.updateDocument(doc.id, doc.url);
    }
  }
}
```

#### GitHub Integration via Project Maintenance Utilities

**Simple Automated Updates**: Weekly documentation refresh via GitHub Actions:

```typescript
// Add to project-maintenance-utilities
export class DocumentationUpdateService {
  async updateMobileNativeDocumentation(): Promise<void> {
    const updateManager = new SimpleUpdateManager(documentStore);
    await updateManager.updateAllDocuments(mobileNativeDocsConfig);
  }
}
```

**GitHub Action Workflow**:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/update-documentation.yml
name: Update Documentation
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1' # Weekly Monday 2AM
  workflow_dispatch:

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Update documentation
        run: npm run update-docs:mobile-native
      - name: Commit changes
        run: |
          git config --local user.email "action@github.com"
          git config --local user.name "GitHub Action"
          git add .
          git diff --staged --quiet || git commit -m "chore: update documentation"
          git push
```

#### Benefits of Simple Document Store Approach

**vs. URL-Based Documentation Access:**

- **Reliability**: Local documentation eliminates network dependency failures
- **Performance**: Instant document access from local SQLite database
- **Offline**: Works in air-gapped or restricted network environments
- **Consistency**: Guaranteed documentation availability across all user environments

**vs. Complex RAG/Vector Database Systems:**

- **Deployment Simplicity**: No embedding models, vector databases, or complex dependencies
- **Startup Performance**: Instant initialization - just SQLite and standard parsers
- **Predictable Results**: Each tool knows exactly which document section it gets
- **Minimal Resource Usage**: Standard Node.js libraries only
- **Maintenance**: Simple document updates, no complex reindexing or embeddings

**Core Advantages:**

- **Tool-Driven Context**: Each tool knows exactly what documentation it needs (single or multiple documents)
- **Direct Mapping**: No complex lookup logic - tools directly access their configured sections
- **Runtime Parsing**: Parse document sections only when needed, not pre-processed
- **Standard Technologies**: HTML/CSS selectors and simple Markdown paths
- **Flexible Granularity**: Tools can access whole documents or specific sections as needed
- **No Black Box**: Clear, debuggable document → selector → content flow

**Implementation Benefits:**

- **Fast Development**: No need to build complex search/ranking systems
- **Easy Debugging**: Can inspect exact document content and selector results
- **Simple Configuration**: Just document URLs and CSS/path selectors per tool
- **Familiar Technologies**: Developers already know HTML selectors and Markdown structure

_Priority_: Critical for preventing API hallucination and ensuring generated code follows Mobile SDK best practices while maintaining maximum deployment simplicity and developer familiarity.
