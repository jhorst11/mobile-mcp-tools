# Mobile Offline \- Tool Suite Design

# Overview

This tab outlines the specific requirements and technical design considerations for the Mobile Offline tool suite within the `@salesforce/mobile-web-mcp-server` MCP server.

The Mobile Offline suite provides grounding context and reviews to help LWC developers create components that adhere to Mobile Offline design patterns, by focusing on design patterns that will allow their LWCs to be primed for offline usage by the Komaci offline static analysis engine. This ensures compatibility with offline-supported apps like Salesforce Mobile App Plus and the Field Service Mobile App, which rely on Komaci for offline data priming.

---

# Tool Suite Design

The Mobile Offline tool suite consists of two orchestrated MCP server tools designed to provide comprehensive offline compatibility analysis for Lightning web components.

## Core Design Principles

* **Violation-Focused Analysis:** The primary goal is to identify design patterns that violate offline requirements for data priming and suggest alternative patterns that accomplish the developer's original intent in an offline-friendly manner.

* **Complete Violation Coverage:** Since any offline violation will result in an LWC that cannot be primed, the goal is to equally address every discovered offline violation, to ensure the highest confidence of compatibility with Komaci offline priming of LWCs.

* **Automated Orchestration Architecture:** Two complementary MCP server tools work together with built-in orchestration instructions, ensuring comprehensive offline analysis regardless of which tool is called first. Both tools include explicit LLM guidance for workflow coordination.

* **Expert-Driven Analysis:** Each tool is internally composed of multiple expert analyzers, each specializing in specific offline violation categories. The guidance tool contains expert instructors (providing review instructions), while the analysis tool contains expert reviewers (conducting static analysis).

* **Schema-Driven Consistency:** All tools use Zod-based TypeScript schemas to ensure runtime validation, consistent data formats, and seamless orchestration between tools and results.

* **Transformation Guidance:** Rather than modifying code directly, tools provide detailed instructions for the MCP client to transform LWCs away from offline violations toward offline-compatible design patterns.

## Tool Architecture

### Tool 1: `sfmobile-web-offline-guidance`

**Purpose:** Expert instruction delivery for agentic offline violation analysis

**Internal Architecture:**
The tool contains multiple expert instructors, each specializing in specific offline violation categories that require intelligent pattern recognition and contextual analysis.

**Operation:**
When called, the tool returns structured expert review instructions (`ExpertsReviewInstructionsSchema`) containing:

- **Expert Instructions Array:** Each expert instructor provides specialized review guidance for their violation category
- **Orchestration Guidance:** Built-in instructions for MCP client workflow coordination
- **Expected Response Format:** Complete schema structure (`ExpertCodeAnalysisIssuesSchema`) that LLM responses must follow

**Key Capabilities:**

- **No Input Required:** Provides comprehensive expert review instructions without requiring component code
- **Violation-Specific Expertise:** Each expert instructor delivers targeted guidance for specific offline compatibility issues
- **Agentic Analysis Focus:** Handles violation categories requiring intelligent pattern recognition rather than simple rule-based detection
- **Format Consistency:** All expert instructions specify the same response format for unified result processing

**Supported Violation Categories:**

1. **Unsupported Conditional Rendering:** Detection and conversion of modern conditional directives (`lwc:if`, `lwc:elseif`, `lwc:else`) to legacy directives (`if:true`, `if:false`) required by Komaci offline static analysis engine
2. **Inline GraphQL Queries in @wire Adapters:** Detection and refactoring of literal GraphQL query strings within `@wire` adapter calls to separate getter methods

_[Additional violation categories to be added as agentic analysis capabilities expand]_

### Tool 2: `sfmobile-web-offline-analysis`

**Purpose:** Expert static analysis for discrete offline violation detection and remediation

**Internal Architecture:**
The tool contains multiple expert reviewers, each specializing in specific offline violation categories that can be reliably detected through automated ESLint rule-based analysis.

**Operation:**
When called with an LWC component bundle (`LwcCodeSchema`), the tool performs automated expert analysis and returns structured results (`ExpertsCodeAnalysisIssuesSchema`) containing:

- **Expert Analysis Results:** Each expert reviewer provides specialized violation analysis for their category
- **Orchestration Guidance:** Built-in instructions for MCP client workflow coordination
- **Detailed Issue Reports:** Precise violation identification with location data and remediation guidance

**Key Capabilities:**

- **LWC Bundle Input:** Accepts complete component bundles via `LwcCodeSchema` structure
- **Automated Expert Analysis:** Each expert reviewer runs specialized ESLint rules using `@salesforce/eslint-plugin-lwc-graph-analyzer`
- **Static Analysis Focus:** Handles violation categories that can be reliably detected through rule-based analysis
- **Format Consistency:** All expert analysis results conform to `ExpertCodeAnalysisIssuesSchema` for unified processing

## Orchestration Workflow

Both MCP server tools are designed with built-in orchestration instructions to ensure comprehensive offline compatibility analysis regardless of which tool is called first.

### Orchestration Design Principles

* **Order Independence:** Either tool can be called first - both include orchestration instructions to ensure the other tool runs
* **Comprehensive Coverage:** Both tools must execute to provide complete offline violation analysis
* **Output Format Parity:** Both tools produce review results in compatible formats (`ExpertCodeAnalysisIssuesSchema`) for unified processing
* **Automated Orchestration:** Tools include explicit LLM instructions to handle workflow coordination without manual intervention

### Workflow Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Guidance Tool Called First**

1. `sfmobile-web-offline-guidance` returns expert review instructions with orchestration guidance
2. MCP client/LLM executes the review instructions against the LWC code
3. MCP client automatically calls `sfmobile-web-offline-analysis` with the component code
4. MCP client combines both sets of review results for comprehensive refactoring

**Scenario 2: Analysis Tool Called First**

1. `sfmobile-web-offline-analysis` returns static analysis results with orchestration guidance
2. MCP client automatically calls `sfmobile-web-offline-guidance` to obtain agentic review instructions
3. MCP client/LLM executes the agentic review instructions against the LWC code
4. MCP client combines both sets of review results for comprehensive refactoring

### Orchestration Result

The orchestrated workflow ensures that regardless of calling order, the MCP client receives:

- **Agentic Analysis Results:** Expert instructor guidance executed by LLM for complex pattern detection requiring contextual analysis
- **Static Analysis Results:** Expert reviewer analysis through ESLint-based automated detection for rule-based violations
- **Unified Format:** All results conform to `ExpertCodeAnalysisIssuesSchema` enabling seamless result aggregation and processing
- **Complete Expert Coverage:** Combined expertise from all expert instructors and expert reviewers across all offline compatibility categories
- **Automated Coordination:** Schema-embedded orchestration instructions eliminate manual workflow management

    )
    .describe(
      "Instructions for the MCP client on how to orchestrate this tool with the companion guidance tool for comprehensive offline compatibility review."
    ),
});
```

## Schema Architecture Notes

**Runtime Validation:** All input and output data is validated at runtime using Zod schemas, ensuring type safety and data integrity across the MCP transport boundary.

**Orchestration Integration:** Both output schemas include `orchestrationInstructions` properties with default values that provide explicit workflow guidance to MCP clients, ensuring comprehensive analysis coverage regardless of tool calling order.

**Format Parity:** Both tools ultimately produce review results that conform to `ExpertCodeAnalysisIssuesSchema`, ensuring unified processing of all violation analysis regardless of detection method (agentic vs. static analysis).

**Expert Architecture:** Each tool internally organizes multiple expert analyzers (instructors for guidance, reviewers for analysis) through consistent schema structures.
